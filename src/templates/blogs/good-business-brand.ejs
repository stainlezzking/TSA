            <p>Why is branding important? Branding is the nuanced art of actively shaping your brand. With creativity, skill and strategy, a brand can establish an identity that sets itself apart from the competition and sparks a connection with its audience.</p>
            <p>   Branding is what gives you a reputation and, ultimately, a future. Because of the importance of branding, businesses and organizations should build a strong brand right from the start so they can consistently maintain it as they grow.</p>
            <p> If you’re asking why branding is important, we’d challenge you with a counter-argument: Is there any time branding isn’t important?</p>
            <p>Branding is everything. Here are the main reasons why branding matters.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
            <h3 class="mb-1 orbitron">Competitive Advantage</h3>
            <p>The website reflects the school in terms of values, attitude towards prospects and acceptance of modern trends. Such a development will give your school a competitive advantage and help you set yourself apart from the competition.</p>
            <p>To make the most of the opportunity, take a look at the websites of other schools in the region. What kind of features do these websites have and what are they missing? A little bit of competition research can help you get inspired. You will easily figure out how to position yourself and create the most appealing persona for your establishment.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
          <p>The brand image of a company is the perception of the brand that a customer may have. This perception is created from the interactions the customer has previously had with the company, from the first time they had heard the company name, to the most recent purchase they made. Just like first impressions matter when meeting new people, the first impressions of a brand matter too. When meeting with a new client, you wouldn’t go into the meeting looking messy and unorganized. The same goes for your brand. Creating a high-quality experience from the beginning will set the bar high and give your customers have a good first impression of your brand so that they will have a better perception of your company early on. A good first impression with new customers will show them that your company is one that they can rely on.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
            <h3 class="mb-1 orbitron">Customer Relationships</h3>
            <p>You would want your brand image to be more than just the visual elements of your company. A brand image also comes from the quality of service from your company. When advertising, it is important to think about how you can build a relationship with your customer, not just sell them a product. Customers like brands they can relate to. When they can feel like the brand is an extended version of themselves and identify closely with the brand, they become loyal customers who come back often. If customers can identify brands as having values, this personifies the brand as a brand that cares about the customers and other issues, instead of one that only wants to make money.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
            <h3 class="mb-1 orbitron">Customer Retention</h3>
            <p>A strong brand image can create credibility and customer loyalty for your company. When a brand is known for delivering what they promise, customers will begin to trust the brand. This can increase customer retention and how often they return. Brands can also attract new customers by maintaining a positive brand image and by continuously meeting or exceeding customer expectations. This can be especially important when launching a new product. By having a loyal customer base, it will be easier to introduce a new product to the public and loyal customers will be the first ones to test out the product. Additionally, loyal customers will talk about their favorite companies and brands, creating a chain of marketing that will continue to strengthen the relationship a company has with current and new customers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="mb-2">
            <p>To create a positive brand image, you first need to identify the goals of the business as well as the brand identity of your company. When trying to build a brand image, the goals of the business will help focus marketing efforts. Once the goals are determined, you can start to define the brand image of your company. This should focus on the key differentiators of your product or service. Do you want to be known for your low cost? Do you have the highest quality? By focusing on differentiating your company, this will help you stand out from the competition.</p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Once the foundation of your brand image has been established, you can focus on the marketing activities to promote your brand. By using integrated marketing, you can create a seamless and consistent experience for your customers. A few elements that are important when delivering a consistent message to boost the image of your brand are:</p>
            <br><br>
            <p> <strong>Search Advertising</strong> : Search advertising can be a useful tool when trying to reach your customers when they are on the internet searching for topics related to your brand. Search Engine Optimization can improve the chances of customers seeing your site first in the search results.

            <br><br>
            <p><strong>Public Relations</strong> : Public relations use the media to attract public interest in a product or company. By using PR, you can increase your brand awareness as well as increase the positive image of a brand within the mind of the consumer. Since the message comes from outside of the company, a consumer might be more willing to trust and accept the content instead of seeing it as an advertisement. Another effiective way is through running online ads such as google ads and facebook ads for your business. 7 apex are expertise in helping you run online ads that will bring customers directly to your hands. Studies have shown that 83% of people who are actively online tend to buy products or require services after coming around the online ads.   </p>
            <br><br>
            <p> <strong>Content</strong> : The content is what customers see and how your message is delivered. By creating content that your customers can relate to, you can have a lasting impact on your customers, which in turn creates a strong brand image. Creating valuable content is a critical factor for delivering your message. </p>
            <br><br>
            <p>Creating a positive brand image might be more important than you think. With a strong brand image, you can have higher customer retention and attract new customers who will also become loyal to your brand. Using a consistent message throughout your promotional efforts will create a stronger brand image, but it also takes time and dedication.
