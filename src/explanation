FIRST TIME USING WEBPACK... SO THIS IS MORE A CREATIVE
APPROACH ... I'M SURE I'D LAUGH AT MYSELF ON HOW THERE 
ARE EASIER WAY OF DOING THIS IN THE FUTURE.. HEY BRO, I REALLY
TRIED, I'm HAVING A MIGRAINE RIGhT NOW BUT CAN"T STOP X



the index page loads in 
 > style.scss which i compiled and rendered into the head in the index page
 > the index page is generated by HTML-WEBPACK-PLUGIN in webpack build and the link to the index.js [outputed as main.js] is auto linked in
 > HWP supports ejs but can only require in json or jvs that's how i was able to modulelarize/template my code to prevent repitition, hence for the repetition folder, sorry for the typo :)
 > Webpac supports require.context in the index.js file that's how i am able to load in the image & fonts folders to dist and  use webpack.configure to set the location in the dist
 > All links in the html page have been previusoly set the their relative URL in the dist
